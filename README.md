In this role you will be:
-   Wiring electrical devices that you and your coworkers are going to
    use,
-   Doing some testing on live 480 volt circuits,
-   Advising your coworkers how to stay safe during their work around
    electrical devices.

A full understanding of the topics discussed in the following video will
help ensure your safety and the safety of everyone who depends on you.

At your earliest convenience you need to watch the video at:  
<https://youtu.be/mpgAVE4UwFw?si=8LH7m4NESoRNMt5p>

The presenter is a legend in the industry and he is very funny.  
I hope you enjoy the video.

When watching the video it is understood that:

-   A “fault” is when a voltage carrying wire is touching the metal
    chassis of a machine.
-   “Clearing a fault” means causing a circuit breaker to trip.

As you watch the video I want you to look for the answers to the
following questions that I wrote out for you. Please read the questions first and then
watch the video. Don’t read the answers, just read the questions. Most
of the questions below are addressed in the video – some are not, but
please give all of these questions some thought. Then we will discuss
them together. This is not a test. I already know that you are very
knowledgeable and highly intelligent. This is just a discussion to help
ensure your safety.

-   In the circuits you service, where are the electrons going? (Hint:
    It’s not the ground.)

    -   The electrons are always going back to the power source from
        which they came.
    -   This will be the transformer in the case of AC power in a
        cabinet.
    -   This will be the VFD in the case of a motor.
    -   This will be the power supply in the case of DC power.
    -   The electrons will take any available path but they are always
        going back to the power source.

-   Which organ in your body is it most important to protect from
    electric shock?

    -   It’s the heart. Even a tiny amount of electric current through
        the heart will cause defibrillation and almost certain death.

-   When testing live circuits, why do electricians work with one hand
    behind their back?

    -   This prevents electric current from passing through the heart by
        way of the hands.
    -   Still, even with one hand behind the back electric current can
        go from one hand, through the heart and back to the power source
        by way of legs, hips or torso if you are leaning on the machine
        chassis.
    -   This is why electrically insulated gloves must be worn when
        working around live power.

-   If you are holding a 480 volt copper wire in your bare hand while
    wearing electrically insulated boots and not touching anything else,
    will you get electrocuted or feel a shock?

    -   Your body will now be at 480 volts but there is no path back to
        the power source for the electrons.
    -   With no path back to the power source, there is no electric
        current moving through your body.
    -   So no, you won’t feel any shock and you are not being
        electrocuted but you are in danger. Now is not the time to touch
        the chassis or anything else connected to the neutral terminal
        of the transformer. If you do, then you will become a wire and
        current will pass through your body. If the current passes
        through your heart then you will likely die.

-   What would happened if you are holding a 480 volt copper wire in
    your bare hand while wearing electrically insulated boots and not
    touching anything but then touch that same hand to a metal chassis
    which is grounded to the neutral lead of the 480 volt transformer?

    -   You would burn your hand as electric current passes from the
        wire, through your hand to the chassis.

-   What would happen if you are holding a 480 volt copper wire in your
    bare hand while wearing electrically insulated boots and not
    touching anything but then touch your other hand to a metal chassis
    which is wired to the neutral lead of the 480 volt transformer?

    -   Now you are dead.
    -   Electric current has passed through your heart and caused
        defibrillation.

-   What would happen if you are holding a 480 volt copper wire from
    phase A in your bare hand while wearing electrically insulated boots
    and not touching anything but then touch a 480 volt wire from phase
    B or C with your other hand?

    -   Again, you are dead.
    -   Because phases A, B, and C are always at different voltages at
        any given instant, current will flow through your heart and you
        will die.

-   What would happen if you are holding a 480 volt copper wire from
    phase A in your bare hand while wearing electrically insulated boots
    and not touching anything but then touched another 480 volt wire
    from phase A with your other hand?

    -   In this case both wires have the same voltage at any given
        instance, so your body is at 480 volts but no current is
        flowing.
    -   So you are not dead but you are in great danger.
    -   This is not a good time to lean on the machine chassis.
    -   In fact wise electricians maintain their balance and never lean
        on machines.
    -   And of course wise electricians always ware electrically
        insulated gloves.

-   How do you make an electrical circuit safe to touch?

    -   You disconnect the circuit from the voltage supply.

-   What makes a circuit breaker trip?

    -   A large amount of current passing through the breaker will cause
        it to trip.

-   What is the Equipment Grounding Conductor (the green wire) for?

    -   It causes the circuit breaker to trip in the event that a hot
        wire touches the chassis.
    -   The Equipment Grounding Conductor provides a low resistance path
        from the chassis back to the power source.
    -   This forces a high current to flow through the circuit breaker
        when a hot wire touches the chassis which causes the breaker to
        trip.
    -   Once tripped, the voltage is removed from the circuit and the
        chassis becomes safe to touch.
    -   It may take a moment for the circuit breaker to trip. During
        this time the chassis is hot.

-   Why do we try to make the Equipment Grounding Conductors (the green
    wires) large in diameter and short in length?

    -   This keeps the resistance of the Equipment Ground Conductor as
        small as possible.
    -   Small resistance means maximum current is going through the
        circuit breaker so that it will trip in the shortest amount of
        time.

-   What is the Effective Ground Fault Current Path?

    -   This is the name given to the low resistance path back to the
        power source which is provided by the Ground Fault Conductor.
    -   The Effective Ground Fault Current Path is what causes the
        circuit breaker to trip when a hot wire touches the chassis of a
        machine.

-   Why do we never remove the grounding prong from an electrical plug?

    -   Removing the grounding prong would break the Effective Ground
        Fault Current Path from the chassis back to the power source.
    -   So now when a hot wire makes contact with the chassis the
        circuit breaker will not trip.
    -   The chassis will maintain the same voltage as the hot wire.
    -   In other words, the chassis will become hot.
    -   If you were to lean on this chassis then you would become hot.
    -   And if you reach out and put your hand on another piece of
        equipment or railing which has an Effective Ground Fault Current
        Path back to the power source then current will flow through
        your heart and you will likely die.

-   What is it called when we install an Equipment Grounding Conductor
    to the metal chassis of a machine at one end and the neutral lead of
    a transformer at the other end?

    -   This is called “Equipment Grounding”.

-   What is an Equipment Ground and why is it used?

    -   Equipment Grounding causes the circuit breaker to trip in case a
        hot wire touches the metal chassis of a machine.

-   What is a “System Ground” or “Earth Ground” and why is it used?

    -   A System Ground or Earth Ground is made when the neutral
        terminal from a transformer is connected by a wire to a metal
        rod which is driven into the earth.
    -   This allows transformer and motor windings to dissipate voltage
        spikes caused from Electromotive Pulses (radio waves) which
        result from lightning strikes in the area.
    -   Dissipating these voltage spikes protect the insulation around
        the wires in the transformer and motor windings.

-   What is the difference between an Earth Ground and an Equipment Ground?

    -   An Earth Ground, or System Ground, is a wire going from the neutral terminal of a
        transformer to a rod which is driven into the ground.
    -   An Earth Ground protects motor and transformer windings from electromagnetic pulses caused by nearby lightning
    -   An Equipment Ground is a wire going from the metal chassis of a
        machine to the neutral terminal of a transformer.
    -   An Equipment Ground protects people from electric shock by causing the circuit breaker to trip when a hot wire touches the chassis of a machine.

-   What is a “Common Ground” or “Common Wire” and why is it used?

    -   A Common Ground is used in single phase AC and in DC
        applications.
    -   It carries current back to the power source after it has dropped
        all its voltage across a load.
    -   The neutral side of all loads driven by a power source will meet
        at this node which is why these are called the Common Wires or a
        Common Ground.
    -   The Common Wire is usually white in both AC and DC applications.
    -   The “Common Wire” is really a branching tree of wires all
        connected to the neutral side of a DC power supply or AC
        transformer. But since they are all connected together, they are
        thought of as single Common Wire.
    -   Do not confuse the Common Ground with the Equipment Ground nor the Earth Ground discussed previously.

-   Why should only fault current be allowed on an Equipment Ground but
    not working current?

    -   The Common Ground (not the Equipment Ground) is for working
        current making its way back to the power source after dropping
        its voltage across a load.
    -   The Equipment Ground is reserved only for Fault Current. This is
        current caused by a rogue hot wire which has come into contact
        with the metal chassis of a machine. This is the current which
        trips the circuit breaker.
    -   Since we don’t want the chassis to carry current and since the
        Equipment Ground (green wires) make contact with the chassis, we
        don’t allow working current on the Equipment Ground wires.
        Working current is reserved for the white Common Wires.

-   What is “Bonding” and why is it used?

    -   Bonding is electrically joining all metal parts of a building
        structure including water pipes together by wire and joining all
        these by wire to rods driven into the ground.
    -   This is done to protect against arcing between metal parts of a
        building when nearby lightning strikes cause electromotive
        pulses in the building.
    -   This is for fire protection.
    -   Without the bonding these pulses would cause arcs which might
        pass through combustible materials to cause a fire.
    -   Machinery is not usually bonded to a building because the same
        voltage spikes in the building which create arcs can destroy
        solid state electronic equipment.

-   What would happen if you touched a 120 volt wire to a rod driven
    into the ground?

    -   It would create a voltage gradient in the earth starting at 120
        volts and dissipating to zero volts as distance increases from
        the rod.
    -   The dissipation with distance is not a linear function. Most of
        the voltage is dropped near the rod.
    -   So if you step near the rod with one bare foot and step away
        from the rod with the other bare foot then you have a 120 volt
        potential between your feet which could kill you.
    -   Touching a 120 volt wire to a grounding rod would not likely
        draw enough current to trip a circuit breaker so the gradient in
        the earth near the wire would remain energized. This is an
        accident waiting to happen. This is why Equipment Grounding is
        so important when Earth Grounding machinery.

-   What would happen if you touched a 120 volt wire to the metal
    chassis of a piece of equipment which has a System or Earth Ground
    but no Equipment Ground?

    -   A voltage gradient would form around the grounding rod but not
        enough current would flow into the earth to trip the circuit
        breaker.
    -   As a result the metal chassis would remain hot at 120 volts.
    -   The ground at the grounding rod would also be hot at 120 volts and a voltage gradiant would spread out from the grounding rod.
    -   If you were to touch the hot machine with one hand and touch another
        Equipment Grounded machine with the other hand then current
        would pass through your heart and you would likely die.
    -   If you have bare feet with one foot near the grounding rod and another foot further away from the grounding rod then your feet would be at different voltages and current would flow through your body and you could die.
    -   If you were to touch the hot machine while standing on the ground with bare feet then electical current would pass through your heart as it travels from hand to foot and you would likely die.

-   What would happen if you touched a 120 volt wire to a metal chassis
    which is Equipment Grounded?

    -   In this case the circuit breaker would trip and nothing bad
        would happen.

-   Does an Equipment Grounded chassis protect you from electric shock
    in the event that a hot wire touches the metal chassis?

    -   Yes it does.

-   If so, how does the protection work?

    -   The Equipment Ground Conductor provides an Effective Ground
        Fault Current Path. This causes a large amount of current to
        flow through the circuit breaker which causes it to trip. Now
        the hazardous voltage has been removed from the circuit.
    -   There is an erroneous notion that the Equipment Ground Conductor
        keeps the chassis at zero volts when it comes in contact with a
        hot wire. This notion is false. The chassis will remain hot
        until the circuit breaker has tripped. All the voltage must be
        dropped across the resistance of the Equipment Ground Conductor
        and the windings of the transformer. The neutral terminal of the
        transformer will be at zero volts but the machine chassis at the
        other end of the Equipment Ground Conductor will remain hot
        until the circuit breaker trips.

-   Does Earth Grounding a chassis protect you from electric shock in
    the event that a hot wire touches the metal chassis? If not, then
    why not?

    -    No it does not. Earth grounding only protects the insulation of
        motor and transformer windings from high voltage spikes caused
        by electromotive pulses from nearby lightning strikes.
    -   The earth does not draw enough current through the rod to trip
        the circuit breaker. So the machine chassis, the ground wire,
        the ground rod, and even the earth near the rod remains hot.
    -   If you were to touch the metal chassis then you would become hot
        – that is you would carry the same voltage as the chassis. If
        you were to then make contact with any conductor which is
        Equipment Grounded or if you were to make contact with the earth
        then current would pass through you and you would likely die.

-   If System Ground or Earth Ground does not protect people from
    electric shock then why is it used?

    -   Earth grounding protects the insulation of motor and transformer
        windings from high voltage spikes caused by electromotive pulses
        from nearby lightning strikes.

-   What types of devices should be System/Earth Grounded?

    -   Any devices that have windings such as motors and transformers
        act as antennae for the Electromotive Pulses (radio waves)
        created by nearby lightning strikes.
    -   This creates high voltage spikes within the windings that break
        down the insulation of the wires that make up the windings.
    -   Eventually you get short circuits within the windings and that
        makes the motors and transformers useless.
    -   Providing a System or Earth Ground allows the voltage spikes to
        dissipate into the earth without harming the windings.

-   What types of devices should not be System/Earth Grounded?

    -   Digital electronic equipment should not be System or Earth
        Grounded.
    -   This is because you don’t want the voltage spikes picked up by
        transformer and motor windings to fry your delicate digital
        electronic circuits.

-   Does System/Earth Grounding protect equipment from a direct
    lightning strike on a building?

    -   No, a direct lightning strike on a building will do enormous
        damage no matter if there is a System/Earth Ground or not.
    -   System/Earth Grounding only protects motor and transformer
        windings from Electromotive Pulses (radio waves) generated by
        nearby lightning strikes.

-   What is a Lightning Rod and how is it different from System/Earth
    Grounding?

    -   A lightning rod is a structure that goes over and around a
        building but is not connected to it. The idea is to draw
        lightning into the rod, away from the building, and into the
        ground.
    -   A lightning rod protects the building from a direct lightning
        strike whereas a System/Earth Ground protects motor and
        transformer windings from radio wave pulses which are generated
        by nearby lightning.
